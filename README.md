# SendSMS*Note: This is super early alpha. All rights reserved, use at your own risk, no guarantees offered.*SendSMS syncs Android SMS between your SIM card equipped device and your computer. An Android app pushes your texts to a computer through a server client which is deployed and controlled by you.&nbsp;## The Goal<!-- Texting from your computer can be great. You don't have to go find your phone if you left it somewhere else in the house, and if it's charging on the table for an event later in the evening you'd rather let it soak up some power even while you're in the middle of a texting frenzy.-->SendSMS syncs your text messages between your Android device and your computer through a self-deployed server. Your texts aren't sent to some anonymous server controlled by an entity that you may or may not trust, and all of your information is encrypted even while they're sent back and forth on your own network.### UsageThree parts are necessary for this to work:- <b>Android app:</b> The included .apk file can be downloaded onto your Android device. Follow instructions in the app to get it hooked up to your server.- <b>Server:</b> The server executable can be ran on whatever computer you so desire. The server uses a command line interface which will show you its IP address for use with the app and computer client. Your texts aren't kept on the server, but are simply passed immediately through to your client and then forgotten.- <b>Client:</b> Your computer will use a client to obtain messages which are passed through the server.
